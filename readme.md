# Presentation on Jupyter Notebook

I gave a talk as part of the Genomic Tools Workshop on March 24, 2016 titled "Jupyter Notebook: A tool for well-documented, reproducible bioinformatics workflows". 

I set up this repository as a demonstration of how to share a completed Jupyter notebook via GitHub. 

You can view the demo notebook from the talk by clicking on the ".ipynb" file above, or via this direct link: [https://github.com/MikeTrizna/jupyter_notebook_presentation/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Talk.ipynb](https://github.com/MikeTrizna/jupyter_notebook_presentation/blob/master/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Talk.ipynb).
